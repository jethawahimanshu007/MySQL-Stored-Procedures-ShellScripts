# MySQL-Stored-Procedures-ShellScripts
This project contains samples of optimized stored procedures out of hundreds of procedures written for MySQL database at previous work place. Some use cases were analyzing the network data collected through SNMP from the network components to find out the CPU utilization, temperature of the routers, average, max, min out of a set of values for all routers or a set of routers. Traffic analysis was also done
to find out the maximum traffic, min, average of traffic in certain time duration for certain part of network or the entire network. 
DiffServ traffic, TCP traffic, etc was analyzed. 
Different types of reports were generated daily, weekly, monthly and yearly so that the client could use the data to charge their enterprise customers for the used data based on our reports. 
Shell Scripts and batch scripts were also written to automate this. Visual Basic code to convert from CSV to Excel files was also written automatically. Trimming scripts were also written for SQL data.
